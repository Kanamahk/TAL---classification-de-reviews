Overall, I would say the base game itself isn't the best but what makes this so eyecatching and popular is the modding and flexibility it conceives,
 players are free to add multiple things (with the skillset) which could enhance and make the replay time more fun,
 you can drain countless of hours into this due to the amount of modding that the great community, they shaped it that way.
