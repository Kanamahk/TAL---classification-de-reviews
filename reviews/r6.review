Garry's Mod, for me, is a must recommend. I've has this game for 4 years, and it never lets me down. A thriving community; a colossal set of workshop addons; and off-workshop addons; and free software, or addons, to make your own addons. Although the game is great, it has its ups and downs.
CONS:
Graphics: Since the game runs on the Source engine, it is forced to run on Half Life 2's graphics and has not increased in graphical value all the years it has been available. To counter this, the amazing GMOD community has made many mods that increase graphics, increasing lens flares, blood graphics, gore, and gun detail.
