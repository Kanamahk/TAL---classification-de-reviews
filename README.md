Authors : Tristan HERMANT, Shankar SIVAGNA, Bryan VIGEE

Domain of the study : video games reviews from the Steam platform.


To run the program, you just have to execute the file main.py.

It is possible to add new reviews. 
To do so write your review in this format :

Name of the game as it is written on Steam
recommended/not recommended
hours that the author played the game
number of reviews written by the author
number of game possessed by the author
text of the review

You then save it with the ".review" extension and save it in the review repository called "review" located in the project repository.
